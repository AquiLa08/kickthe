<p style="text-align: justify;">Many weapons won't be available when you start out, but that doesn't mean there aren't any tools that can help you get your cash flow started. The machine gun is great for farming cash, as is the grenade, which you'll receive from the very beginning. The grenade's explosive power can help you earn 100 bucks or more in one fell swoop.
As you make progress in the game and begin to unlock more weapons, pay attention to which ones give the most money to keep that upward momentum
