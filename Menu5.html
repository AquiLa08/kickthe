<p style="text-align: justify;">Beating up Buddy will earn you a small amount of Bucks for the damage done. Some items are more efficient at harming Buddy and earning Bucks (and you won’t earn any Bucks for just hitting him with your fingers without an item).
Our favorite weapon for grinding Bucks is the F1 Grenade under the Explosives category: this item is unlocked at the beginning of the game, so you can use it right off the bat. Each time a grenade explodes on or near Buddy, you’ll earn four Bucks. It’s easiest to just repeatedly tap the screen to unleash a rapid volley of grenades on top of him, and then let the explosions throw him around the box. Between the first grenade you drop and the time he is KO’d, you should be able to earn at least 100 Bucks easily.
Once Buddy is KO’d, you’ll no longer receive Bucks for harming him. You need to wait a few seconds for him to automatically revive—his eyes change from X’s back to the normal buttons—before damaging him again. If you notice that you aren’t earning as many Bucks from a weapon as you previously were, try switching to a different item for a short period—until his next KO—and then swap back to the one you were using.</p><br>
