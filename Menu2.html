<p style="text-align: justify;">The two currencies in <strong>Kick the Bdy&nbsp;</strong> are Bucks and Gold. Gold is a premium currency that can only be earned by purchasing it directly with real cash, or occasionally earning it as a log-in bonus. Bucks can be netted in both of these ways as well, but you can also collect it via simply playing the game—beating up Buddy.
Both currencies are used to purchase the 'Stuff' used in your never-ending war on Buddy, although items cost either one or the other. You cannot buy Stuff that costs Gold with Bucks, and vice versa, so you’ll need both in order to kit out your arsenal.
