<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kick the Bdy&nbsp;</strong>is an addictive beat-em up (blow-em up?) that's more commonly tagged as a stress reliever rather than a formal game. You're given a slew weapons which you can then use to take out your frustrations on the titular buddy, a stuffed doll.
The only real goal is to get as much money as possible to unlock new weapons to give you even more ways to kill the buddy. Here are a few tips to help you unlock every weapon in the game.
