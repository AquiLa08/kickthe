<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any in-app currency, you can purchase Bucks and Gold directly for real money. To access the in-app shop, tap the Gold and Bucks icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. You can also pull on the red bookmark in the upper-left corner, tap Profile, and then select Bank (the Profile area is also where you can buy new clothes for Buddy or change his outfit, via the Wardrobe section).
Gold and Bucks start at $0.99 for 100 and 1,000, respectively, but there are quite a few items that cost much more than this individually. We recommend grinding a bit via the tactics below before opening your wallet.
