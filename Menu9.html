<p style="text-align: justify;">Don't worry, you don't actually have to post anything to your feed to get these Instagram exclusive weapons. You only have to push the Instagram button, where it will give you options for confirming and publishing your post. You can back out of this once you push the button, and you'll still earn the weapon. You're only rewarded for initiating the action, not completing it!</p><br>
