<p style="text-align: justify;">Quite a few items within the Stuff menu have a large, green 'Free' sign in place of a price. Tapping on these will bring up a cost in Gold as well as an alternative way to earn the item. The types of alternatives include watching videos, inviting friends, or following Shelzy on Instagram.
For the latter two options, as long as you are connected to the internet you should be able to fulfill them fairly easily. You can simply tap the Instagram link given in-game to open the web page, even without being logged in to Instagram, and it will count as following—once you return to the app, the item will be unlocked.
If the requirement is to invite friends, tap the button and the contact options (email, messaging, etc.) will pop up. Choose email and email yourself. Do this three times to unlock the item.
The video requirements don’t have any special tricks, but they at least don’t have to be done in a single sitting. Kick the Buddy will track how many videos you’ve watched even if you quit the game. However, the video requirements are per item, not total, so if there are two items that require you to watch 100 videos, you’ll have to watch a total of 200 videos to unlock both.
The video requirements also seem somewhat arbitrary: for example, the Bio Weapon Acid Balloons can be earned by watching 100 videos or by paying 379 Gold outright. Meanwhile, another Bio Weapon—Prion A-51—can be earned after watching only five videos, despite costing 499 Gold. Because of this, we strongly recommend checking the Gold requirements and buying reasonably priced items directly before settling in for a massive video-viewing binge.
