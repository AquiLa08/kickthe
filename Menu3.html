<p style="text-align: justify;">The easiest way to earn free currency and Stuff is to simply open the game at least once a day. There is a new log-in reward every day you play, with large bundles of Bucks ranging from 350 to 1500 Bucks as the primary prize. If you log in for 15 days straight, you’ll earn at least 5,100 total Bucks this way.
There is a smaller amount of Gold available through these log-in rewards, as well as exclusive items that cannot be bought: weapons like the Torch, X-Ray, and Snail can only be collected via the daily reward. Even if you don’t plan on playing on a specific day, try to open the app long enough to snag these prizes.
